# 修改让它适用于玩小黄油
增加了上下左右键盘

# ScreenKeyboardEscFn
Screen keyboard with Esc, Fn keys (F1 to F12), and other keys only.
Might be useful for those who wanted to use small clamshell PC
by compositing Windows tablet and Bluetooth keyboard case (for iOS/Android),
and then broke into tears by finding some keys missing.

For example: 
- Windows tablet: Teclast X89Win (http://www.teclast.com/zhuanti/X89Win/)
- Bluetooth keyboard case: HB045 (http://item.rakuten.co.jp/tabtab/at60451/)
